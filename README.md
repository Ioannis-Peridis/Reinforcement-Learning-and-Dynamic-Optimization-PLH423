# Reinforcement-Learning-and-Dynamic-Optimization-PLH423
These are the labs of the Course : Reinforcement-Learning-and-Dynamic-Optimization-PLH423

with professor : Thrasyvoylos Spyropoylos

from: Techincal University Of Crete

Implementation in Python: Stochastic bandits environment with uniformly distributed rewards, algorithms implemneted: Îµ-Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound(UCB) using rewards.
Experts and adversarial bandits enviroment, algorithms implemented: Mulitplicative Weights (MW) on experts and bandits environments, UCB using losses (negative rewards).
Convergance speed/learnign rate, commulative regret, performance comparing, different parameters tuning.
